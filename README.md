# Product-Video-A-B-Testing
Conducted an A/B test for an online apparel site to find the causal relationship of product videos on its page with sales of that product.   

## Approach
• Implemented randomization check on the dataset to validate the integrity of the test using pivot tables and t-test in excel to find the control and treatment group have similar statistical properties.    
• Performed difference of means and regression analysis to find the effect of videos and other contributing factors, on excel and R programming using panel regression modelling accounting for fixed effects.     
• Calculated the combined effect of videos and other promotions on sales of the product using a regression model including the interaction terms for different promotions with videos.
